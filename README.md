# Introduction

For the past year I have been thinking about creating a website that will act as a junction for all my other websites and/or related links.

However, I did not want a Craigslist-Style website listing all the links on one page. I wanted something interractive and fun. A website that sparked interest and excitement.

Unfortunately, at first I had no idea how to tackle such a website. I looked through many example website with great designs but none of them sparked the interest in me until I learned about THREE JS.

THREE JS JavaScript Library allowed me to create 3D Environment on a website. This instantly opened a flood gate of ideas.

At first I wanted to create something like the loading screen from ```No Man's Sky``` game. Which looked something like this:

In the loading screen, you go through a procedurally generated endless clouds of stars where some of them are associated with names.

I wanted to copy this idea and assign my websites for each of those stars. However, thinking more on how to implement this idea reminded me that, the website needs to be easy to use and having to wait for the specific star to pop up for this specific website isn't really fun.

Hence, I moved on to a Soler System idea, where I would assign a website onto each of the 8 planets in our Solar System. However, that posed the question "Which website is associated with which planet?"

Which brings the final idea of using only the Earth with lots of nodes representing the geolocations of the websites I have created or related to.
