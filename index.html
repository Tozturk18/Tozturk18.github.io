                    My name is Tuna, I am an international student from Istanbul, Turkey.
                    I major in Engineering at Dartmouth College and I double major in Physics and Computer Science at Wheaton College MA.
                    I aspire to become an Aerospace Engineer with a good background in Electrical, Mechanical and Software Engineering.
                    I had to chance to go to United World College Changshu, China where I got the privilage to learn from many people from different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, races, and countries.
                    I was lucky to take classes such as Design & Technology, and Physics that propelled me forward with my engineering and design career.
                    Since then, I have taken courses such as Fab Academy and many other Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering related classes
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still learning a lot everyday. Currently, I am really interested in subjects such as hardware and silicon engineering. Thus, I have pursued a passion at Fab Academy
                    and since finishing Fab Academy, I have created many projects. Currently, I am working on writing an Bootloader for an ATtiny1616
                    to flash from an SD card. I am also working on creating my custom smart watch and a JavaScript Framework for HTML Canvas to create easier rending options for 2D/3D rendering, game development, Computer Aided Design, and many more...<br><br>
